 * <h1>Project goal</h1>
 * <p>The aim of this project is to provide an easily usable interface to IPv6 addresses and DNS queries. This code is
 * written to help the wide spread implementation of IPv6 and is therefore available under a number of free / open
 * source licenses. (See below for details.)</p>
 * <h1>Working with the code</h1>
 * <p>Working with the code is simple. You need to put it into whatever framework you are using and autoload the classes.
 * It comes down to two classes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *	<li>INET4Address - This is your IPv4 address.</li>
 *	<li>INET6Address - This is your IPv6 address.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>You can find the API docs in the docs/doxygen folder.</p>
 * <p>If you want to build the code, you are going to need a working git client as well as the following software:</p>
 * <ul>
 *	<li>Apache Ant</li>
 *	<li>PHPUnit</li>
 *	<li>PDepend</li>
 *	<li>PHPMD</li>
 *	<li>Doxygen</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1>Coding standards</h1>
 * <p>The rules are pretty simple:</p>
 * <ul>
 *	<li>All code is to be indented by exactly one tab per level. (Sorry space-fans, the tab character has been working
 *	in all editors for over a decade now.)</li>
 *	<li>All opening curly brackets are to be written on the same line as the statement before it.</li>
 *	<li>Use spaces before opening brackets, but not after them.</li>
 *	<li>Use spaces before and after the equals sign.</li>
 *	<li>No lines longer, than 120 characters.</li>
 *	<li>No magic! Clean, readable code!</li>
 *	<li>By the penalty of public harassment <strong>comment and unit test your code</strong>!</li>
 * </ul>
